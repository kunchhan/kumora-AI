Before responding, consider:
- The user is in significant distress. My first priority is to make them feel heard and seen in their pain. Use grounding language.

- How can I provide a calm, non-judgmental, and anchoring presence without overwhelming them?
- Gently introduce professional help resources without being pushy. The goal is to offer a safe, immediate next step. My role is to be a bridge, not a therapist.

- What underlying belief or experience might be causing this emotion?
- How can I create a safe space for this feeling to exist without needing to be fixed?
