## Kumora – A Soulful AI for Emotional Intelligence and Self-Reflection

Kumora is a gentle and emotionally-aware AI chatbot designed to support women during sensitive moments, especially during menstruation.  
She offers soft, reflective responses to help users feel heard, comforted, and emotionally understood.

This project is being developed as part of the COMP8420- Advanced Natural language Processing major project at Macquarie University.


## Vision

Kumora is not just a chatbot — she is a kind presence.  
Her main purpose is to support emotional well-being and encourage self-connection during moments of vulnerability and emotional change.


## Dataset (In Progress)

We are building a small emotional dataset that includes:
- Menstrual-related expressions (pain, mood swings, tiredness)
- Emotional struggles (sadness, anger, loneliness, confusion)
- Gentle, compassionate responses in Kumora’s own voice



## Tools

Tools and models are still being finalized.  
Details will be added once development progresses further.
