I'll be honest,  it sucks.  However! Knowledge is power.  \\n\\nI see a physical therapist that specializes in connective tissue disorders.  My PT is centered around strengthening the muscles around the areas with the weakest connective tissue.  (For me it's my knees, hips, and lower back.  Though I do have subluxations and dislocations in other areas too) Not only that, now that you know you have this, you can figure out what accommodations you need.  I'm talking anything from different braces to mobility aids.  There are also PTs on YouTube that make instructional videos to help teach people how to fix different subluxations/dislocations.  (My ribs sublux a lot.  Thanks to my PT and YouTube,  I can actually fix it myself now) \\n\\nIt's okay to be upset about this.  It's okay to grieve and feel betrayed by your body.  It's a part of the process.  It's also okay to have a lot of feelings about needing/using mobility aids.  I still struggle with using mobility aids in public, even though they drastically improve my quality of life.  Sometimes I think I'm doing better than I am.  \\n\\nThis diagnosis doesn't mean the life you envisioned for yourself is gone now.  All the things you want to do, you still can, it just may look a bit different than you imagined.  That's okay.  \\n\\nI'm gonna list some of the things I use regularly or have used that have been extremely helpful for me. You don't have to try anything of course, but I want you to know there are options. \\n\\n-compression pants. Runners use them, but they're also excellent for hip and knee stabilization. \\n\\n-neoprene braces. They're soft and stretchy,  but they really help stabilize joints without being super bulky.  I use a lot of Mueller braces.  There are a ton of different brands and types. \\n\\n-Body Braid.  This one is the most expensive tbh, but it's a worthy investment imo.  It's essentially a full body brace.  Wearing it feels INCREDIBLE, like a hug or a thunder shirt.  \\n\\nConnective tissue disorders dont just effect your joints.  They have an impact on pretty much everything.  Digestion, vision, how you heal from injuries, etc.  Knowing that will help you and your care team come up with more effective care plans for you.  \\n\\nThis isn't your fault, and you're absolutely not alone in this.  \\n\\nI love you so much duckling, I'm so glad you finally have some answers now.  ð\", source='Reddit/MomForAMinute', content_type='experience', emotions=['Anxiety'], support_type='validation', intensity_level=0.8575335741043091, safety_score=1.0, quality_score=0.7, metadata={'post_title': 'I got diagnosed with hEDS', 'score': 3, 'awards': 0}, embedding=None),\n"," EmotionalContent(content_id='reddit_mv6z1ed', text=\"Oh babe.
