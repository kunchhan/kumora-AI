Lightheadedness, Nausea (from pain), random headaches, muscle cramps/aches, diarrhea for the first couple days, severe body fatigue, boob pain/swelling, and let’s not forget the classic mood swings from hormones and hating your painful existence and lack of sleep caused by (any or all) of the listed symptoms.

Guys, imagine waking up at 2am in pain, covered in blood (and your clothes/sheets), feeling all of the above symptoms listed earlier and forcing yourself to swallow painkillers and have a shower and barely get another 30 minutes  sleep before getting up for work because the bloody painkillers took hours to kick in.

Not really a health issue, but let’s throw in “panicking from knowing you can’t change your pad/tampon for several hours at work/an outing and fearing not having constant access to a toilet”. 

And there are women who bleed heavily so guys please imagine having to think of an excuse for the toilet again after everyone noticed you going to the toilet 20 minutes before.

AND we have to pay money for “luxury comfort items” such as hygiene products, painkillers, head pads, ruined clothing/sheets that needs to be replaced, and he’ll let’s throw in maybe 20 bucks of comfort food since you can’t stomach anything. We have to pay for all of that AFTER LOSING WORK DAYS from being sick.

Throughout all of this, you can literally feel gloppy clumps of blood exit you, and have to keep a straight face in public when you stand up and feel it sliding out. 

If you use tampons instead of pads, they can also cause cramps, and make you need to pee constantly (from experience).

Everything I eat and drink comes out as either vomit or diarrhea. Tea? Vomit. An apple? Vomit. And it’s not once sometimes it’s like 4 times within 1 hour. I can’t eat anything, so I usually just don’t eat or drink the first day just to avoid vomiting 24/7. 

Thank god it’s only the first day, sometimes also the second day. The remaining days of my period I’m fine.

That's what it feels like for the two 'heavy' days of my period. 

In fact, I often spend a lot of time running to the bathroom because I'm *not really sure* if it's just the period or if I *actually* need to poop. (I actually started pooping my pants once because I put my money on the wrong end of that bet ha)

About three days before my period, I start feeling very tired, achy, and ""foggy"". Easy tasks feel hard, I lack motivation. I may feel more weepy or irritable (because of the nature of this ""brain fog"", I often start to worry that something is Wrong. Then I feel like an idiot when my period starts exactly on the day it was supposed to. Repeat this every month lol)

After the second, heavy day, the tiredness / ache / fog pretty much lifts, and since the blood flow is just wrapping up, I can use lighter pads.

c_ecxbiqr,"Let’s go on a journey. Now periods, much like snowflakes, are unique and every woman has a different experience. So here’s my personal hell:
You start getting stomach aches. Like, “ate bad seafood” stomach aches- the kind that set off alarm bells in your head and send you rushing to the bathroom. But these are just slightly lower. They start out dull and increase with intensity. They hit randomly and fade away within a minute. At this point it would behoove you to start taking pain killers, not that it’ll help much. A few days later, that stomach ache has evolved into something akin to a stab would on top of bad seafood. You feel drained. Exhausted. There’s something about being in constant pain (and yes, on the first day it’s constant. Sometimes it’s a dull throb and sometimes it’s a sharp, prolonged OW FUCKING OW). The particularly painful cramps hit out of nowhere.  That’s usually what wakes you up in fact, and luckily between that and the alarm bells in your psyche you usually make it to the bathroom juuuust as the bleeding starts. Usually. You don’t want to do anything, but you really don’t have an option because you have to be a productive member of society. You’ve got shit to do, and you don’t have time to take a few days off. So add to the physical exhaustion the mental exhaustion of pretending everything’s hunky-dory. You’re hot and sweaty and you smell different- can other people smell that? You’re sure they can. They probably can’t, but you’re willing to bet they can. You’re bloated, you’re nauseous, and you just want to go home. Every once in a while someone roundhouse kicks your guts. Life is awful, but hey at least now you’re home in bed, right? 

Wrong. For some reason, and you have suffered this way for years and haven’t found the cure, you just can’t sleep for the first night of bleeding. So you’re awake, aching all over. Did I mention your boobs are sore? Cause they are. They feel bruised and beaten. God help you if you sleep on your stomach, not that you’re sleeping much tonight. 


The next morning you somehow feel worse, as if that’s possible. Imagine the flu, but instead of taking DayQuil you swallowed large chunks of glass and rusty nails. For the first three days of your cycle, you’re bleeding like a stuck hog. You have a box of stained panties to wear for when- not if- you bleed through your tampon. The box gets fuller every month even though you’re SO CAREFUL. After the third day, you still feel tired but the flow lessens and your symptoms ease until you reach the end of the 7th day. And then you get to look forward to next month, and you hope you can plan important events around the red river but usually you can’t because life doesn’t stop when your flow starts. 



But it’s not over yet. A week after the end of your period, in the middle of your cycle, you get awful, hot-knife-twisted-in-my-side-call-the-hospital-I-think-it’s-appendicitis cramps. These are short and usually located on one side rather than both. Your face breaks out, which is fun, and you bloat. Again. You thought your boobs got sore DURING your flow? Oh honey. If they felt bruised before, now you’re sure there’s a boob-bone and it’s broken. You’ve fractured your boob. It’s the only explanation because why else does it feel like Muhammad Ali went twelve rounds with your mammaries. The only blessing is that they don’t hurt if you don’t touch them. Or brush up against anything. Or turn too quickly. 



And this all is only scratching the surface. And usually involves a LOT of pain killers.

They can take away a lot of the anxiety about seeing your blood on clothes or furniture. You can go for longer without having to change a pad or tampon. They take a little getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, they can be a life changer. Also, if you are worried about spotting, you could wear period underwear because if a little blood gets by or if you’re just stressed because you don’t know if there will be blood today, it can give you peace of mind.

Usually around day 1 of my period I can't do anything, the rest of the time it's just a nagging strong pain that I can dull with advil but not erase. I've gone to the ER for it but apparently nothing is wrong, lol.

I get ovulation pain too, also only in my right ovary, which is super annoying.",unlabeled,,7qhc8d

But, a couple times a year (like two or three times) they surface with a real rage. I call these times the ""lady flu"" because the cramps get so bad that it makes me throw up, I get feverish, and chills. I'm left bedridden from it for at least the first day (and if I had unlimited sick days, I would prefer to stay home for the second day too since the pain isn't too much better until the third day.)

It's not so bad if I catch it right at the start of it and dose up on extra strength liquid advil (surprisingly thr only thing that helps now) but if I don't catch it right away I'm down and out for a couple hours.

I used to take alieve and I would be good for a long time but one day at work, I was having the worst cramps of my life and it was to the point where I had to fill an empty bbq sauce jug with hot water and hold it myself.
I took about 4 alieve in the span of 5 hours and all I wanted to do was lay on the floor and sob.

Even on the months when these things are *so* bad, they are still *bad enough* that I sometimes miss work. Like even after several, several ibuprofens, I still will stay home because I don't want to leak onto my office chair.

A heating pad feels incredible and calms them down, where as before the heating pad would only work after advil. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Two theories I will share for other ladies: 
Kale. Greens. Sautéed. I started eating kale more often a few weeks before my first pain free period, then just kept with it because sautéed kale with garlic is delicious. Didn't eat it one month and my cramps were very close to how they were before. Second, kombucha. Google it, but basically it's super beneficial with probiotics and lots of other good things.

inb4 genuinely no idea whats going on, even my doctors are clueless and im not ""qualified"" to hop on operating table lmao (honestly idgaf about having no babies but its illegal to have the necessary procedures in my country in most cases)
i highly doubt its pcos or endometriosis since ive been to a shit ton of various different doctors over the years and theres literally nothing wrong
if any of you girlies have any ideas please let me know, im barely 22 and its completely ruining me ntm how many times i skipped work just because i literally wasnt able to get up thanks to paralysis (im on the thin line of getting fired again too thanks to this)

He has made us all connected so that we may know one another and feel as one that we are not alone. We are the vessels of life into this world. The greatest strength comes from within and connecting with your spirit. You and every woman before you has known this pain as the universe must live in harmony and balance. In exchange for life brought in we must first understand the miracle that is our body and how it works perfectly to do what it is made to do. Imagine that the pain in a dragon woken from a deep slumber who roars with a voice so strong so she may be heard from miles around, she’s saying “notice me and help me to find peace” noice how she swarms and moves throughout the body and visualize the path she takes. Breathe into heart, a spirit of healing, compassion, love, and grace. Instead of letting that frustration consume you, image how that roaring flame is getting smaller and smaller with each breathe, and watch as it calms and cools down deep in your belly until she is asleep once more. I pray you find peace from within and peace with yourself as you remember that it’s okay to take up space, okay to acknowledge your strong feelings and reflect on why you’re heard and what you can do for yourself in this moment. What a gift it is to slow down and make time for loving yourself that best way you can. May Gods loving hand be felt on your heart this day and every day here after.

vp-pJXhWwhg_C451,"Hello for everyone who has extreme severe pain on their first day of period, feels like they will pass out, has to throw up and thinks its the last day of your life. My sister i am with you in all of this. I used to take heavy medications to have less fear of this day but that isnt a solution.
I couldnt bare it anymore so i did some research.
What causes this tremendous pain is the lining of the uterus shedding. To be more precise at the beginning of our period (even a few days before) specific hormone levels drop which signal the uterus ""its go time"" and they release a hormone that causes massive cramping for the uterus to shedd its lining. 
To prevent this hormones to drop like a MFer I went on a quest of non medical solution search that can help. 
I came across a ""menstruation tea"" (a herbal tea sold in germany in DM) and i drank it during my period and it has no effect at all.
The next cycle i tried it again this time starting to drink it 1 week before my period. My whole period was delayed for 5 days but once it came it wasnt so bad. No puking no starving no feeling like its the last day for me on this earth.
I will leave the ingredients here im sure chatgpt can translate i only know the names in german.
It is a blend of the following herbs:
Frauenmantel,
Schafgarbe ,
Angelikawurzel,

I suffered for years myself, but thanks to supplementation, the nightmare ended. It's also very helpful to drink an infusion of red raspberry leaves, chamomile, and ginger a week before your period. I'm not a doctor, and this is not medical advice, just methods I've learned from clinical nutritionists and herbalists that have helped me, so I'm sharing them with you.",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

Was prescribed anti-inflammatory pills , but instead changed my diet to antiinflammatory foods. The big one for me was eliminating gluten. Also been drinking smoothies/juices much more. As well as eating foods that helps clean the liver & avoiding processed food. This helped tremendously!!! My cramps seriously feel very tolerable now, i havent thrown up (yet) since, im now lying on my bed instead of bathroom /shower floor , no crying , none of that.

i recommended listening to this through headphones, i dont know why but it works so much better that way. 

also if you have really extreme bleeding or pain, please see a doctor. i was diagnosed with pcos & endo, and they gave me tranexamic acid which slows down the bleeding, and some extra strong prescription painkillers. im not a doctor, please seek your own medical advice.

vp-pJXhWwhg_C840,"Here are some recommendations that might help😭😇

1. When it first starts i really would not suggest you waiting for the cramps to get intense before using pills or what type of reliever you use, asap (as soon as possible) is the best go get u something to eat, take a warm shower/bath and do what u gotta do. 

2. If you're taking pills for cramps without eating anything like any solid food then the pills are likely not gonna work or help much with cramps, I've noticed that a lot, so even if u don't have any appetite try to at least eat a nice amount of food before taking pills this way it'll work more efficiently. 

3. After taking pills it takes about an hour or 2 before it actually starts to relieve the pain i know it's hard and it can get really frustrating but it is what it is😭

4. Some pills I'd recommend that actually works for me (Motrin, Advil, Alene, Ibuprofen) it's VERY IMPORTANT that u EAT FIRST. 

5. I drink warm water a lot, anything warm will usually help u use the bathroom more freely especially if u like tryna take a dump and it's really painful or u can barely function😢

6. I'd really advise u stay away from really cold, sugary things or even extremely spicy food i know some people have cravings but what i do best is really avoiding it at least for the first 2 days when cramps are really bad. 

7. when using a heating pad/hot water bottle if the water/heat pad is extremely hot, it can actually make u really uncomfortable and make the cramps worse I've noticed that a lot so usually don't put directly on skin

8. If you know your period is a week away and u the type that consumes a lot of sugar or sweet/cold things don't, like really I'm being so serious, it'll get so bad you'll feel like dying so honestly i really do just be avoiding these things when it's a week away cause i know it's gon get real bad. 

9. I know this may not help everyone but i like to take one of my pillow and put one of my leg on it, it kinda helps me a little bit. 

10. Being in a really stressful environment can help u feel even more frustrated or angry so if you're cramping really bad I'd recommend a nice quiet place and if it's like in public trust me just take the day off or something if u have to. 

11. Doing some simple exercises/yoga can help temporarily relieve pain.

Imagine a barrier of warm, radiant energy thats flowing through your body. Through your breasts that might feel sore, let the warmth get into every and each pore, healing your pain. Let the warmth sink into your lower back, stomach, and thighs. Just a wave full of healing energies. 
Repeat this with me: 
My pain is fading. 
The feeling I have right now, is temporary. 
I will be ok. 
I am connected with my body and believe in myself to get through this. 🤍

Relax your body as you’re repeating these. Let your body sink into whatever you’re sitting/laying on. Feel your body. Comfort yourself. 

To anyone reading this, my heart goes out to you 🩷 
We women are in this together. Our menstruation connects us all. Our empathy , compassion and so much more deep emotions are shared. Rest, take a day off, sleep in, and most importantly: take care of yourself. During this phase in your body you are the most connected with yourself. Treat yourself how you’d treat a loved one. With warmth, and love.

vp-pJXhWwhg_C1263,"I have had terrible cramps for 30 years and my cycle has also changed every 10 years or so with allied symptoms and changes in flow. Here are some things I’ve tried that have helped greatly:
- first go to a good doc and be sure you don’t have STIs, cysts, endometriosis, or anything else medical. 
- diet: before my cycle I try to cut dairy and drink/eat more veggies and green juice
- stretching: you may not even be aware that you have fear of your cycle/the pain and tense up. That makes it worse. Stretching helps you loosen up and let go of the fear. 
- CBD with terpenes 
- healthy cycle tea from traditional medicinals used to knock out the cramps but they changed the formula. So it helps but not the same now. Also horsetail tea. 
- heating pad or warm water bottle
- sometimes birth control pills made it less intense, but for me they always had some other side effect 
- honey pot menstrual pads and panty liners with herbs. I think that tingling is increasing blood flow or something during the rest of the month and it also smells good/cuts way down on the smell of the product before you take out the trash. 
- rest. If you have sick leave, don’t try to push yourself. It’s ok to take a moment to tend to yourself. 
- little belly rub from Moon, CBD suppositories from foria also have helped. 
- exercise: usually athletes have better cycles. Figure out what works for you and you may have less intensity on pain and flow. 
- reusable pads: this isn’t for everyone but I def felt my flow was less and it helped me to stop feeling like my blood was gross. 
- ginger and turmeric: ginger tea several days leading into it or even ginger candy. 
- lavender essential oil in a diffuser for sleep or peppermint for nausea. 
- bananas for diarrhea 
- I now get period flu with my cycle so I take cold flu meds sometimes. Smh it’s wild

1. CASTOR OIL applied after every shower or bath to lower abdomen and womb area, a thin layer is enough. Also applied daily before bed into the belly button, just a couple of drops. Make sure to get the hexane free castor oil. 
2. KINESIOLOGY & ENERGY HEALING. I had no clue that these sorts of therapies existed but 10 years of extreme suffering lead me to research every possible solution and I was willing to try anything. I was sceptical but both of these healing modalities provided me with the kind of releif I had almost given up hope of finding.

vp-pJXhWwhg_C1348,"To everyone saying they’re sobbing in pain, rocking around/rolling, screaming or wailing, please go to a doctor. It’s not normal to have that extreme amount of pain. It could be something serious like endometriosis which is where the lining of your uterus is coming off and ‘tangles’ itself. It could also be polyps which are small bumps in the uterus which makes the blood harder to go through. It can also be other things but there’s a reason NHS websites/or your local hospital or health clinic websites exist. I would highly recommend getting it checked out. For quick pain relief, HOT baths. Don’t have a shower, a bath is like a full body heat pack and it does ease pain. Free bleeding in the toilet is also good, and not wearing tight clothing or underwear. If you’re over the age of 16 in the UK, you’re able to get checked out internally by a doctor for anything that could be wrong. If you’re younger, still talk to your doctor. It’s a good idea. Remember, it’ll be gone when you’re 50-60. 💗",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

vp-pJXhWwhg_C1351,"Beautiful ladies searching for pain relief. Please get tested for endometriosis. You can get a blood test which can be an indicator of endometriosis- called a CA125 antigen test. Internal ultrasounds can be conclusive too. Avoid toxic chemical cleaning products, soy, inorganic foods sprayed with pesticides (the worst are the dirty dozen) things like wine are extremely high in pesticides when aren’t organic. Pesticides behave like hormones in the body and cause pain. Stay away from plastic containers and don’t use microwaves with plastic. Micro plastics also behave like hormones and cause issues for endometriosis. Stay away from non organic dairy , stick to eating an anti inflammatory diet (Google it) and invest in a juicer, the sana Omega 7 juicer is amazing. Consume ginger turmeric and lemon daily. Avoid cold drinks and liquids. If you can afford acupuncture, get it once a week or at least a month. Practice yin yoga and be gentle with yourself. Have hot baths with 1kg of salt and no chemical bubble bath in there. Buy a 100% darl quality chocolate, mix it with warm non dairy milk , quality raw honey and a sprinkle of salt, your symptoms will improve. Sending love",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

So long slow inhale through the nose for a count of 5, then hold your breath for a count of 5; then long slow exhale through pursed lips for a count of 5, and then hold your breath again for a count of 5. And just keep doing that, no matter how bad the pain gets. I definitely find it helps. When our breathing becomes too fast and/or too shallow, not enough oxygen circulates to the organs that need it and they cramp up, so not breathing well while on our periods makes cramping worse.

I know it isn’t fair and I don’t know why this normal bodily function has to be so excruciating for so many people. Try to unclench your muscles. Release your jaw. Try to breathe slowly and deeply. When you exhale, imagine the pain leaving your body with the exhale, and relief flooding in with each inhale. Even if you’re only imagining it at first, soon the pain will begin to dull and fade.

There was a time the only pain worse than a toothache were my menstrual cycles. The past so many years, however...Though the first day is still slightly uncomfortable, what truly made a difference for me was dissolving as many mainstream feminine ""care"" products as possible. Since I stopped utilizing pads in general, my cycles have been lasting only a few days.. with 90% pain reduction, and the flow isnt like a geyser anymore 😂. It wasn't until recently I actually started exploring the possibility of chemicals and the effect they do have on my body. Though it was something I always felt didn't feel right, it was life changing to confirm my theory. 
It was scary and can get messy sometimes, but the pros outweigh the cons in my experience.

And my back hurt in a different way…from sitting for long hours in the past couple years working on this project. I had to return home and curl into a ball, turn on the heat, drink hot water and hot chocolate, and rest. But it just wouldn’t go away…I can’t even sleep. And all I could think of is I lost another day to work on the project. I’m so alone and terrified. And then I found this music.

vp-pJXhWwhg_C1696,"Hey, I hope all of you ladies are pushing through this pain! It’ll be over soon. As someone who has experienced a period for years, I’ve figured out a few things that help. Every body is different but these tips may work for some of you so I’ll leave the tips here: 

1. Bananas. Eat Bananas. Period cramps hurt sooooo much and if you have nausea with it, it’s even worse. I have both of these. Bananas have been one of the only foods I can eat during my period. I discovered it once because I just wanted one during my period and it relieved so much pain and discomfort. 

2. Try to eat softer/plainer things if you get Nausea. Chicken noodle soup, plain  toasted bread, plain toasted eggo waffles, and bananas.

3. Heating pads help so much ladies!!!! If you don’t have one and can’t get one, get a water bottle and fill it up with warm water instead. You can put that on your tummy instead.

4. Drink ginger tea. It helps with nausea and is said to help with period cramps as well. 

5. If you get gas cramps (aka butt cramps lol), buy some gasx pills at the grocery store. They help with those pains so much. Also if you get gas pains, avoid eating apples on your period.

6. If your body is intolerant of any foods (lactose/dairy), STAY AWAY FROM THOSE FOODS ON YOUR PERIOD. It makes your period soooooo much worse. Try to eat clean and avoid greasy foods, dairy (if you’re intolerant), and super processed foods like chips. (You can have saltines tho). 

7. A little bit of Dark Chocolate can help pain due to the magnesium in it. 

8. If you get nausea, make sure to stay elevated if you’re lying in bed (stack pillows). If you have one of those reading pillows it can help a lot. I’ve found that lying flat can lead to me throwing up. Also, don’t think about throwing up. Try to think about other things. If you think “I’m gonna throw up, I’m gonna throw up, I’m gonna throw up,” you most likely will. 

9. Keep a trash can with a trash bag by your bed in case you don’t make it to the bathroom. 

10. Look up period stretches/positions to relieve pain. If you’re in too much pain you may not be able to do this but give it a try if you can. 

11. Keep a pillow behind your back as well as in front of your stomach. It really helps support your back for back cramps. 

12. If you get the butt cramps I was talking about earlier. They’re basically just sudden sharp pain in your booty, make sure to breathe in and out deeply (I know it hurts so fricken bad but just try to). 

13. Drink lots of water babes ❤🫶

I hope these tips help! I love you girlies! We can do this!!!!❤🥰🫶",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

- look up accupressure points and yoga poses for menstrual cramps
- massage your feet and legs, it distracts and relaxes, while getting you in touch with you body. Caress your hands, your face.
- breathe!
- warm food, veggies, diet matters, lot of info to find about this
- be more kind to yourself than ever before

Let it be a chance for us to be called back to connect with ourselves. Rest deeply if you can. Don't let anybody or any to-do-list take that from you. I know it can be hell and you just want to get out of it, but if we can turn inward and listen deeply it has gifts and deep teachings for us. No need to understand; just feel, just be, just breathe. Know that it is temporary pain. 

You're doing great. There's nothing wrong with you. Lean into the process. If there's resistance let there be resistance. If there's anger, sadness, fear let yourself feel it and know it is not you. It is all temporary, just wanting to be felt, wanting to pass through you. 

And can you notice all the space around the pain where there is no-pain? And can you notice the waves, the ever changing symphony that this pain is?

Enjoy the sweet relief afterwards. It is yours to claim, you moved through it once again ❤❤❤

My deepest love and reverence to you all.

If you're nonbinary, Or a man, Or maybe none of those that experience a period, Maybe you don't get a lot of help *because* of your gender or the way you present yourself.
I've felt that.
Back in my abusive household I was always told if I *want* to be a real man I should just suck these feelings up, Either that. Told to stop talking about periods because that's not something a *real* man would talk about.
I feel your pain, Including on the nonbinary spectrum.
It really sucks being disrespected/Disregarded because of the way you are

It is caused by hormonal imbalance. Severe pain might be a symptom of an illness - it's always best to have a blood test and an ultrasound.  If everything seems to be ok try changing your diet and lifestyle. I used to struggle with very painful periods since I was 11yo, but since changing my diet to whole food plant based, the pain lasts only a day and it's managable. The food you eat does matter, the lifestyle you have does matter. And if nothing works for the pain, anticonception pills work wonders. Hugs to all of you <3",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

- don't eat sugar or coffee during your period!! Especially not in the first few days
- if you suffer from severe cramps, try taking magnesium like one week before the period kicks in, it helped me a looot!
.-drink raspberry leaf tea, I assure you, this helps me so so much!! 
- take monk's pepper
- and ofc, if it's too bad, take pain pills, ibuprofen 600mg is the best for me!

If these things don't work out for you, please go see a doctor, your period shouldn't hurt like hell, this isn't normal (a ""normal"", slight pain is), you might have hormonal issues (like my doctor found out I have too little Progesterone in my body) or endometriosis!!",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

vp-pJXhWwhg_C1874,"Hey girls! We are all doing amazing, and it’s amazing how freaking strong we are 👏. I just wanted to give you guys some tips for dealing with cramps, coming from a daughter of a holistic and homeopathic healer! (my moms kind of a good witch lol)
1. Music like this is sooo so good for you and really helps. These kind of vibrations are great for pain! 
2. If you are rolling around, kicking your legs and can’t find a good position, lay on your side in a fetal position. It may not work right away but for it to work you must stay still, and then your body will start to calm down!
3. Take deep, regular breaths. Breathing is really important to tackle down pain!
4. Raspberry leaf tea is a woman’s best friend. Super amazing for you and your reproductive system, and helps a ton with cramps! 
5. I don’t recommend taking pain killers, as they are not good for you, and the more you start to take them, the less they work. Instead, take magnesium pills! They work like magic for cramps, or homeopathics. They’re super natural and you can take as many as you need without damaging your body and they work amazing!! The one I’m taking right now is from the company Boiron, and this specific one is called Caulophyllum Thalictroides, but you should look at the homeopathic list for menstrual cramps on their website because homeopathy is super based on your symptoms, like the most minute small symptom like the area around your neck is super hot or you have no flow or very little flow in the moment. Trust me, it SAVES YOUR LIFE!!!
6. If you are experiencing hot and cold feelings and can’t decide if you want the blanket on or off, I have a solution for you! Have a warm cover on your stomach area, and only cover down to your knees! If your feet are getting cold, just cover up and have your arms out! Keeping your stomach warm is super important, not just when you’re on your period! 
I really hope these tips help you girls, these things always make my periods wayyyy less painful and more of a therapeutic relaxing time for myself! When the pain is over, and you are comfortable and relaxed, it’s the best feeling of relief ever!! You are not alone, we all go through it, and you are so strong 💪 men have no clue 😂 but the good thing is that we do. All women understand each others pain and that’s what’s so beautiful about being a woman. We have a special connection between each other, ❤ an inseparable bond. I know it’s hard to not hate your period, but having a period is what makes you woman!! God chose US to go through this because God gives his hardest battles to his strongest warriors, he knew that we were more mature than men to have periods, be pregnant, and giving birth! So so so much love to all my girls, you make me so proud 🥹, and you are so close to reaching the end of this horrific pain.

Everyone else is asleep so I couldn’t ask for help, I was basically almost  crawling to the bathroom just now. I’m just hoping that the ibuprofen kicks in as soon as possible, I’m 19 and having periods for 10 years now so I’ve dealt with a lot but this is definitely one of the most painful cramps i’ve ever had 😭",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

The calm amazing music and the beautiful words written by my sisters (that are going through the same pain) are the best medicine: this comment section is pure kindness and it makes me feel less alone. It's like we women, beautiful and strong creatures, are all deeply connected.
And the music is literally the only thing that reduces my pain.

You are stronger than you think and believe me: this will stop. It's temporary. Think about that beautiful wave of cozy feeling after the cramps: focus on that feeling. You got this.

I know what it feels like. I know it hurts. But you don't know how strong you are. You and your body. Together you get through this, no matter what.
If you took a painkiller, if you have a warm a bag of grain or if you don't have anything, it will still go away.
It's okay. It is okay to cry. It is okay to throw up. It is okay to roll on the bed or floor. It is okay to smash your pillow. You are okay, and you will be okay.
If you read this down here, think about this: your pain soon fades away. Every seconds, every minute. The pain will go away. I promise. You are strong. We are strong.

vp-pJXhWwhg_C2161,"If you don't have access to heating pads rn here's what to do: 

Take a reusable water bottle (preferably plastic , it retains heat better) 

Pour hot/warm water into it 
you can use boiling water from a kettle and let it cool down a little bit or fill the bottle with warm water ( from the faucet I guess) 

Close the lid properly; you can use a rubber band if the lid is loose. (or a piece of clothing to prevent leakage) 

Place it on your belly or your back 
Don't put it directly on your skin. use your clothes or a towel as a barrier 

*Don't worry the plastic won't melt.
260°C melting point vs 100°C
It might only become mildly flexible if it's a very thin layer of plastic.

-drink a lot of water it helps with cramps
-bananas and dark chocolate helps with pms and cramps
-get a hot water bottle or heating pad to help cramps (if u don’t have these items get a plastic bag fill it with hot water and put the bag of water in a towel)
-once this music relieves your cramps try walk around for example around your house,around a room, or if your up for it down the road
-take some medication example paracetamol, panadol, ibuprofen 
-drink tea the best ones are ginger tea or peppermint tea to relieve cramps 
-if you have nausea drink tonic water (small sips) it helps alot

The week before your period, a lot of water each day! (5-8 cups a day). Take pain relieving pills three days every day before your period as the bottle directed. Bring the amount of sugar and junk to zero. Do period cramp relief yoga each day and  even on your period. Drink chamomile tea. GET A heating pad.

So let me tell y’all my symptoms now that my cramps have completely eased… finally!  so every first day of my menstrual cycle, I wake up with intense pain in my belly, I immediately have diarrhea and vomiting come over me, and intense cramps that I can’t even stand up. I barely every make it to the bathroom, I end up puking in a bag. And there’s moments where… prepare to be disgusted…. I’ll feel like I need to puke and poop at the same time. Does any other women have that??? I’m generally so curious! But anyway back to my symptoms. I always get the chills too! Like really bad chills, I can’t even handle any intense temperature change or anything like that. Like when I have my heading pad on, I enjoy it for a good minute then a couple secs later I’m sweating so I take it off. then again… I’m cold! So I put it back on. It’s just so terrible dealing with that… and I get super light headed and my heart and chest hurt from heavy breathing and anxiety over this extreme pain I’m facing…. Anyway thank you for reading and I hope you can relate to me in some way, and If you do.. let me know! And let me know if you think all of this is normal for us women… sometimes it just scares me. Anyway I love you all, sending my loving healing energies to us divine goddesses 🥹💓🥰💋",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

Take some paracetamol or Ibuprofen whichever your able to take as it will give you some relief for a little bit and may help you to sleep and once your asleep you hopefully won’t feel them again until the next morning!

But enough about me, I hope you are all doing ok, remember your not alone! 

What I find relieving for my cramps is;
A hot water bottle specifically either a really fluffy one or a long one
A fan on in the bedroom so you don’t get too warm as for me I tend to feel sick if I get too warm

Stick something quiet on in the background like this video on a low volume but loud enough to hear it still, I tend to either use my nausea relief audio, this video or some asmr videos to help me relax and sleep 

Drink water if you can, I do struggle to remember to drink water but water is best to drink, it may not be flavourable but drinks that are fizzy and coffee related can usually bloat you, anything sugary can but depends on you and your body of course but I tend to bloat quite a bit if I drink fizzy juice or eat something sugary

I felt so so desperate, and like murdering someone, but as everyone is alseep, I didn't get the chance. (...This is my period mood and humor, I'm not serious about the murder. Even if I think every woman here must sometimes feel like assassinate too. 🙃"":')) 

I ended up here on this dear YouTube, and under the comments of this video. Without realizing it, I started to feel a bit better with all the kindness that is present here. ❤ 

I do feel really alone in the period pain, but even if I'm alone and with the cramps in my bathroom at 3AM... after reading this, I realise so many women must feel just as alone and tired as me right now. 
So. To all the alone and tired people : I'm sending you all my love and my bravery. ❤🌻 Every month I think I can't do it, and every month I do it. I feel weak, but in fact... this is being pretty strong. Keep the faith, keep your calm... try to breathe and relax.

Please do not let anyone tell you that extremely painful periods are normal, THEY ARE NOT NORMAL, you are not weak, you do not have a low pain intolerance, YOU ARE IN PAIN and that’s not okay! 

I spent 10+ years of my life trying to get doctors to listen to me when I told them how painful my period was, all of them sent me home with either contraception or pain medications and told me to get on with it. 

I went once again to a doctor when I was 24, knowing I’d probably get the same answer as always; but it was worth a shot. She referred me to a specialist, a couple months after I saw the specialist I was in hospital having surgery to get ENDOMETRIOSIS removed from a large potion of my internal organs. 

Painful periods aren’t normal, having “the period poops” isn’t normal, having to take pain medication while on your period isn’t normal, pain during sex isn’t normal, reoccurring UTI’s aren’t normal.

Please consult with your doctor if you are having these types of periods ladies! Also search up endometriosis and poly cystic ovary syndrome to see if any of these symptoms apply to you. 

I hope you all get the answers you are looking for and I hope they pains you are getting ease away with this helpful music! ❤️",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

Tips for cramps:

DRINK SO MUCH WATER PLEASE ITS SO GOOD FOR YOUR BEAUTIFUL BODY

Drink as much raspberry leaf tea as your body can hold!!! I’ve been drinking it almost daily for a while now and I now have 4 day periods instead of 8, my cramps are significantly better and my pms symptoms are much better every month. It tastes pretty good, just add some honey and you’re good to go.

Sometimes when I’m in a lot of pain I place two ice packs in between my legs right up against my groin and under my lower back, and a heating pad on my abdomen. The ice helps with soreness (especially on your 😺 because it can get sore during your period,) and the heat is best for your abdomen. Alieve, ibuprofen, and midol are my go-to pain meds. A tip is to start taking meds a few days before your period around the clock so it’s already in your system which helps with less pain. 

There are some fabulous stretch videos for period cramps, they help a lot and I highly recommend Yoga With Bird videos especially, her stretch videos are so relaxing. 

One specific stretch that’s great is child’s pose but put a pillow in between your legs for less pressure. It’s really calming and comfortable, and you can even hug the pillow instead so you’re folded in half; I’ve nearly fallen asleep like that it’s so nice.

Lastly, take care of yourself and don’t put any pressure on yourself to get certain tasks done when you’re in pain. Your health comes first, don’t ever strain yourself because it will make your body so much more unhappy.

I hope you feel so much better soon <3",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

Once I got unconscious in thr washroom for 5 7 seconds, I cry, I use hot water bag, even pain killers but duh I don't want to take pain killers.
I wonder how will I work what will I do in life,I'm 23, what if I had my exams today. I keep thinking that I will get up yes I can but nothing Not exaggerating it takes so much strength and will power to even move my hand, mouth to eat.
I only walk through my bed to the washroom and everything gets ruined 🙂.

1. lay on your back, legs folded and ball your hands in fists with the thumb in.

3. DO NOT put your full weight onto your fists (obviously). Roll your hips so you can feel your fists massage the area. 

- if you want to be extra, get a dumbell (replaces the fists) and something thick and soft to cover it. Place the dumbell with the thick covering, underneath you to the area of pain and roll your hips to massage. BE CAREFUL with the dumbell way though!

vp-pJXhWwhg_C2977,"Hi beautiful people! ❤️ I want to share with you things that have worked for me:
1. Stress is your biggest enemy. I noticed that my cramps are worse when I have a lot of my plate. Try to relax before and during your period - you can for example exercise or take a bath (the water shouldn’t be too hot though)
2. Drink a lot of water and chamomile tea and avoid junk food and sugar.
3. Be careful with pills. It’s easy to overdose when the pain is extremely strong.
4. Take 2-3 drops of lavender oil and massage gently your belly while breathing deeply. It helps to relax your muscles. You can mix it with jojoba or coconut oil if you have sensitive skin.
4. Yoga is very helpful. Search for practise for menstruation/PMS.
5. If the pain is excruciating - guys please see your doctor! The doctor will find a way to ease your pain.
6. Most importantly - be good for yourself. Do your favourite things and sleep properly. It’s a special time in the month and you deserve rest.
Hope this helps. Take care you all ❤️❤️",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

Relax your muscles as best as you can, don't fight it. Connect with your body, remember to give it love- it deserves it, always. Do something that makes the pain bearable. There are some things that might help you. Drink lots of water or tea, get a heating pad if you have one, listen to this audio, open a window for some fresh air, if you really can't handle it take some pain killers, eat something that makes you feel nourished, lay down and cuddle a stuffed (or real, if you have one) animal or blanket, stay calm even in the middle of this storm. It will pass. Just remember to breathe with each wave of pain. I love you all, you are amazing. I'm sending lots of love your way.

Also, I feel like someone needs to hear this: You don't need to put pressure on yourself to act normal (like this doesn't affect you) or be productive.

I'm hurting so much right now and you prolly are,too, just know you are not alone, i wish you all the best and just know that your period does not make you any less of a man or an enby. Its normal and its just another thing our body does.",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg
vp-pJXhWwhg_C3060,"A little tlc for those with horrible pains! 

1. A week out from your period take lots of hot bubble baths! Do not under any circumstances put epsom salt into your baths! It will dehydrate you and make the pain worse! There are lymph nodes along your pelvic region and this is where blood flow is prominent! The heat warms up your feet and preps the blood flow ahead of time to minimize cramps. Prostaglandins are the cause of pain. They are used when the body thinks you are dying. The more prostaglandins the worse the pain! 

2. Keep your digestive system flowing! Lots and lots of water and smoothies! Green green green! The day before your period or the first day immediately drink banana, pineapple, carrots, ginger, maca powder and agave smoothie! It will numb any pain! 

3. Yoga and stretching ! Do not tense up your belly region! Keep yourself relaxed as much as possible. 

4. A cool little trick I learned. You can calculate how bad your period is going to be by the level of soreness your nipples and breasts reach! This can help you prepare and plan. 

5. DO NOT use perfumed pads! They are chemicals and this is a huge neglect for your baby girl down there! She needs to breathe. Always use non herbal pads. Best brand I have found so far is Honeypot brand in target. 

6. Keep tea on deck! Mint, elderberry, moringa, maca is amazing! Moringa and maca is a powder. Include them. A great brand I found for tea is Kemiyahstea. The brand is holistic and the herbs are super fresh! To figure out the freshness of herbs go by smell and energy! 

7. Keep yourself hydrated! Eat fruit! No junk. Minimize high cooked foods and fried foods. 

8. Practice positive chanting to your womb. Embrace. 

9. Keep your feet decompressed. If you wear sneakers and tight compacted heels.. keep them off! You cut off your circulation. Your feet breathes! Go stand in grass or soil! 
Same with clothes! No bras, jeans, or tights. That’s too much pressure. 

10. A few plants inside your home goes a long way! Fresh air! And of course it simply makes you happy to look at lol 

Hope this helps!",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

vp-pJXhWwhg_C3081,"To anyone who is really really struggling with the pain:

I know this is horrible
It’s okay to cry or scream or punch a pillow 
I know it hurts so bad and you’re so tired and miserable and you just want it to stop 
As hard as it is, take a long, deep breath in, hold it a few seconds and slowly let it out. 
You feel like you can’t handle this, but you’re handling it right now, you strong badass you! And your brain is also making endorphins to comfort you right now since you’re in so much pain, meaning that when the pain starts to fade away, it will be replaced by a sleepy, fuzzy, cozy, wonderful feeling of relief and you will probably have the best nap EVER. 
And the pain WILL go away. It always does. It’s horrible and so hard in the moment, but this will pass.
Every minute you get through is a minute closer to relief. You know that feeling, when you start to notice that the cramps aren’t as intense, and they’re starting to get more spaced out, and you know the storm is passing.
This storm will pass. It’s okay if you have to throw up. It’s okay if you’re on the toilet. It’s okay if you’re crying. I know it’s scary to be in so much pain and feel so unwell and just be helpless to make it go away. But it WILL go away on its own. Maybe you’ve taken some medicine, or are using a heating pad, or any other remedy, and that will probably help. But even if you’re not, the pain WILL go away on its own. 
Keep trying to breathe as evenly and deeply as possible. Keep telling yourself “this too shall pass.” Keep imagining how amazing it’s going to feel when the pain goes away. Every second, closer to that wonderful relief. Know that there are millions of people in the world right now going through what you’re going through, and I know that doesn’t lessen the pain, but it may make you feel less alone. You are all much, much stronger than you think you are. May your pain go away quickly, friends. I love you ❤️",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

vp-pJXhWwhg_C3134,"A few months ago my period made me faint, I hit my head on the bathroom sink and can call myself lucky that I didn't end up getting any serious health problems from that. I had fainted multiple times before that already but after that I now very much do not want to go outside the first 3 days of my period anymore, even less than before. On Tuesday I went to school after having been sick for a few days before that when I was supposed to have gotten my period. Then in the middle of the school day I got my period. I went through with it for a few hours but then in the middle of the last two lessons I had to go outside to get rid of the stupid mask for a bit. I'm honestly surprised that I did not throw up and/or faint this Tuesday. My mom was working so she was unable to pick me up from school, luckily I also didn't faint on my way home, which was also about 2 hours.
Now it's Thursday and I'm still not in school again simply because of the absolute pain im feeling. 
I'm scared that if I would go I would end up throwing up or fainting, the mask does not help at all. 
This freaking stupid mask honestly only makes things worse for me, my mom said that we might be going to get me to the doctor to not have to wear a mask anymore. After all it's more of a health risk for me to wear one than to just not wear one. 
Cramps and back pain are currently a very bad thing going on, im also feeling nauseous as well as dizzy. 
I've been sick a lot and my period does not help with that, the boys of my class are apparently also already betting on when I'll be in school or not. 
This is awful. I hate it. 
I talked to someone about it in school and she said that I should go and maybe get the anti baby pill or something. I told my mom that advice then and she said that she does not want me to take it. 
This feels like hell. 
I hate it. 
The freaking period is the only thing that I've against being a female. I've had it since I was like 11, why the hell would I be getting a baby at that age? I'm now 16 and I'm still not planning on even stopping being a virgin for possibly 10 years or more still, if ever.

vp-pJXhWwhg_C3329,"I am in pain right now, and just want to write. I have used this video to ease my pain for a long time now. I am a male; I have had chronic stomach pain since I was about 11. I am 28 now. I am tired. I have an attack about once a month. Each time I come back during an attack, I read through the new comments to help me get through it, and I see the old comments I've liked from the last attack I went through. It helps remind me that ""this too, shall pass.""

I can't imagine what each woman in the world goes through. But I know some of the pain. It is immobilizing, crippling, and sorrowful. I have cried from it. I have yelled from it, begged for help. I have been to so many doctors. It can be maddening, it can be demoralizing. The most unfortunate part to me is that it can be defining. I feel as though my identity slips away into the pain. I do not tell my closest friends how bad it can be. I don't want anymore of me to be known as ""the pain"".

I am not very old, but I am already so tired. I don't know if the pain will ever pass for me. I think I will die at a younger age because of it. My motivations for life slow down, my ambitions are drained after an attack. It is not a natural pain. It is twisted, and gross, and I hate it with every part of me. 

But the pain has made me a better person. More empathetic to others. I now know that many times, other people are fighting their own, quiet battles. I genuinely wish I could spend my life helping others combat their pain in some way. To let them know that, it does pass, eventually, and we do get better at fighting it. I do not yell as much anymore because of it. I grit my teeth, and think of the good times I will have with my loved ones when it is over. 

You will get through this. Perhaps it is a cliche to say that the pain makes you stronger. But the pain also makes you wiser, more humble, and more empathetic. 

The pain will make you tired. Tired of life, tired of living. But don't let it stop you from being you. Don't let it drain who you are. You can and will become who you want to be despite the pain.

If I do die younger than most, then I will still be glad to have lived as I have. I will happily wave a farewell to the pain as I go. But I will be grateful that it taught me how much others suffer in the world, and how to care for them. It has taught me how you all continue on. How so many in the world fight battles so greater than them, and keep living on. ""I will not go silently into the night,"" I will go knowing that I never stopped fighting the pain, and I hope that you all never stop fighting it, too.",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

Do's and dont's during your period to lower the pain:

Dont's: No sweets, chocolate, in general: sugar! I know it's super hard but you will see, sugar only makes the pain worse.
Also: No coffee!
No alcohol!

Do's:  this video :)
*hot pads*
take some magnesium before your period starts, it might better the cramps
chaste-berry might help! (it does for me) but you need to take it at least 3 months so that it really helps you

ofc, if the pain is unbearable: Pain killers! I recommend Ibuprofen 600 mg + Buscopan (both together).
the anti-baby-pill can help a looot too! but it comes with side effects/ a risk too, take that in mind.

I have had severe cramping sometimes and it's absolute hell to go through. Medicine usually sorta prevents this but I still have bad cramps. Here to kinda mentally prepare myself and trying to relax. I hope this time isn't too bad, I'm just really anxious!
I most definitely hope I can go back and say it wasn't to bad.

Update to myself:
It's been a year or more and the cramps aren't so bad that I consider ending myself anymore. I honestly don't know why this pain went on for so long but I finally have something that makes the pain okay. 
I am on birth control!! YAY
Not that it went smoothly, when I tried my first set of pills, I got so nauseous that I couldn't eat or drink anything. That has happened multiple times. The first time was very severe and was genuine torture for a couple of days. But I kept on trying with a different set of pills and that went rocky as well but didn't make me violently I'll.
I kept going because I needed the pain to stop hurting me that fucking badly. I can't put into words how much pain it has caused me. We lost so many days of our lives to it. We mostly couldn't do anything on the first day of our period. But now it's now longer like that and I even forgot that it was that bad on the first day. I am no longer deathly afraid that I might get my period on a bad day. I can regulate it now.

I'm also currently on my period, cramps are still pretty shit but I can move around, do fun things, talk and not be to bother by it. That some pain killers almost always helps now. That wasn't the case before.

Thank fuck this helped!
Otherwise I wouldn't have survived it I think. I'm pretty content with my cramps. Something to be proud of and enjoy it. You, me, we finally did it. We finally achieved what we thought was impossible.

It's mainly recommended for pregnancy to reduce labour pains but it also works for cramps too. I have been drinking this tea for 3 months now and it has helped a lot. Also, I recommend to drink it either everyday or at least everyday for 2 weeks before you start your next period and drink it during your period also. Make sure it's the organic tea  too. I hope this will help many of you out there. Your strong. You've got this.",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

vp-pJXhWwhg_C3516,"Ayo to the babes that are watching this. Read my comment to help distract you. I’m writing this to help distract me haha. Alright I just wanna say if you even looked this up just know I hear you. You’re in serious pain. SERIOUS PAIN. And you’re an absolute trooper for dealing with it. My waterpolo coach used to say “pain is temporary but strength is forever” and while he was a guy and it was about working out it’s like my period mantra. Because the pain does eventually end and you become stronger because of it. Not only does your threshold increase but your ability to empathize with fellow menstruaters is increased. It’s a beautiful thing honestly. I feel so connected to the women in these comments. I feel valid. I feel seen and I feel heard. But mostly I feel less alone. I often think I’m the only one who’s cramps make them want to end it. But reading about so many similar experiences has changed my mind. If nobody has told you today: you are badass bitch & tougher than you realize. Ya know I might as well vent while I’m here. I got my period really young, on my 9th birthday. And now I’m in college. I’ve always had extremely painful periods. Throwing up, passing out, cold sweats, migraines, screaming, crying, yelling, lying on the bathroom floor naked, shaking, panicking etc. and because of that experience for days every month it makes me nervous to have kids. I don’t know if I will be able to honestly survive child birth. I can barely handle my cramps even when maxed out on pain killers. I don’t want to die during childbirth. I don’t want to put my body through that pain. While it feels selfish I can’t imagine willingly making myself live that hell. Being pregnant scares me too. But I want kids. I want a lot of them. I just don’t want to be pregnant. I am scared of being pregnant. I don’t like vaginal pain. I don’t want to gain weight. I don’t want to have to give birth. It really messes with my head knowing I may miss out on having kids purely because I know I wouldn’t be able to survive the birthing process. I’d like to think I can but I have so much anxiety about it. I’m currently trying to find new ways to relive my cramps. So far the things that work is taking a combination of Aleve, Midol, and Melatonin. As much midol and aleve im allowed to take and no more than 5mg melatonin. I’ve been wanting to try CBD so badly for my cramps so I’ll be trying it soon. I also wanna try smoking from my pen to see if that helps. I mean nothing beats hugging the person you love and hearing their heartbeat but if they’re not around then the sounds of a heartbeat on YouTube! Also pressure points and certain yoga positions! Stretching too! Hot baths, heating pad, bubbly water, ginger candies too. Alright I feel my melatonin kicking in. I love you all so much and hope you get some relief ASAP <3",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

For me that’s 400-600mg of ibuprofen, two heating pads, a Livia, a fan, and this playlist. I lie down on my back, close my eyes and relax until the pain is over. If they get really bad, I call my mom to talk me through the techniques she learned for labor.

I have some sharp pains at the place  near the muscle we use to poop. And sharp pains feel like twitching(?) upwards. It usually comes right after eating during the menstruation period and usually comes with constipation. It makes me want to poop but cannot apply force to do so. The pain reaches to the top for a few seconds then disappear and repeats. Is this what we call cramps?
Before, I have experienced sort of squeezing pain at the bottom part of stomach, that's menstrual pain right? It's not very painful though... But now I have this twitching thing which is so painful when it reaches the climax... May I know how to solve this><",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

• We cut off our lower part of our bodies. 
• You go through pain and die slowly and slowly so you suffer like we have.

You and your dream boyfriend are waking up from y’all’s bed and he gets up and realizes your in pain. He then asks you “y/n what’s wrong?” And you say “oh nothing… I’m on my period” and he looks concerned. “Y/n, do you want me to get you some pain killer?” You agree and he runs downstairs to get it. Literally runs… anyways, your laying in bed hoping this won’t last long as he busts through the door and runs to you. He presses his lips on your forehead then gives you the medicine. After taking the medicine you look up at him with puppy eyes and he says “what?” You say, “will you come cuddle with me” and he says yes. He walks around the bed and tries to get on carefully so he doesn’t move the bed too much.

They already deny women the right to have maternity leave and most women work right up to birth and immediately after. They deny women to have period leave and even deny that it’s painful, but as a trans man you should know the pain and how it’s sometimes unbearable to work through. When people say “boys get periods too” you are comparing bleeding for several days, cramps, naseua, being hot and cold at once, all the pain and the sweating to someone who thinks periods are nothing even though they don’t experience it. Don’t say “boys get periods too”, let’s say “all those born female get periods”.

vp-pJXhWwhg_C4339,"Tips for really bad periods that have helped me: take a dose of Midol after the first 5 minutes of cramps, that way when they ""get worse"" the pain relief will already be in your system. Then, take 2 ice packs, one on the low back/hips, and one to the front body (i usually rest this one in between my thighs and right on the 😺), this way you're sandwiched by cold to help freeze the pain affected areas. Later, when the cold has done it's work (you'll know), take a break and lay comfortably, let your body relax, drink some tea, listen to this video. Then after a good break take a hot pack and lay it over your pelvis/hips and just let the heat burn your ovaries and the pain. After this point you'll probably be ready for a second dose of midol. Remember to drink water and have small snacks (meals if you're up to it) with carbs and protein to keep your body running smoothly. Pick teas with lavender for calming, peppermint and/or ginger for upset stomach/cramps, and chamomile which literally helps anything. Hope these help, and good luck ♡",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

vp-pJXhWwhg_C4529,"✨How to deal with period and cramps ✨

- don't take any pills go natural until it's really really bad or just sometimes !!!! 
- drink lot's of water 8 Glasses if you can and if not then 5 Glasses at least 
- drink hot tea twice a day  in the morning and afternoon
- Do yoga it really helps I don't know why people never talk about such things and only recommend pills yoga is even better than pills I recommend you Boho beautiful PMS yoga video it's literally so good 
- Try reading a book at a cozy and warm place like in the living room on the couch with this music it's really comforting
- go watch something nice I personally like K-dramas and Anime hehe 😂 they're both so comforting too 
- And now the most important part go take a rest go take a nap for at least 2 hours like set a timer and sleep on the fatal position 
- eat something good but also healthy and NO  don't eat any sugary things at all and also no chocolate 🍫 
- and now do some work while eating some fruits especially when you have school and need to study if you can't go to school then don't go just stay home but also study from home that's how you won't miss anything 
- go and put a mask on your face it's so relaxing trust me and stay clean 
- draw something while listening to this it's so good 
- and now the last one ✨ Thank your self and relax now don't thing about anyone or anything thank your self for being so strong at this time now do all this I really put lot's of hard work in it I hope it helps ✨ 😊😊",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

vp-pJXhWwhg_C4755,"Here we go again ladies 😭 decided to catalogue some of the stuff that helps me, so it may help you, too!

- Laying with knees at a slightly bent position. That is, a sort of less extreme fetal position on your bed- usually laying on your side with just your legs slightly high. I've noticed that if I bring them too close, it puts too much pressure onto my abdomen, and if I stretch my legs out too far, it stretches my abdomen too much.

- Sitting the same way. Not at a super stretched or bent position, but with your back against the chair back/toilet lid.

- Breathing techniques. Focusing on your breathing seems to help me a ton! usually, when I try to distract myself, it becomes worthless if my pain is too much. So I focus on something in my body instead, which brings me to my next point;

- Listen, I know this is gonna sound SUPER crazy, so I don't even really recommend trying unless you know your boundaries.. but, to me, actually focusing on the cramps for a few minutes or so let's me realize the true extent of the pain and when they come in waves. I don't let the anxiety and sadness wash over me and become vulnerable to my cramps- instead I focus on them and rub my abdomen and gradually manifest them to decrease.

- And, as per usual, anything of warmth. Whether it be a heating pad, hot shower, or even your warm phone, Miss Abdo will appreciate anything that feels cuddly.

- Keep yourself hydrated on not only water, but tea as well if you believe or know that will help the cramps.

- And, last but not least, do not forget to be hands on with Miss Abdo. Massages on my abdomen and even stomach can help alot, especially if they're self-employed and I know just the right amount of sensitivity, pressure and strokes I'm handling.

You can do it, girls. We all have for years. Remember, each time it becomes insurmountable.. you've reached your peak, it cannot get worse and only better. You will get through this no matter what, you're such a strong and powerful lady and deserve all the freedom from your cramps you can get!! ❤❤💖",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

vp-pJXhWwhg_C5070,it’s almost 3 am and i have work at 10 am and my cramps are so bad and i want to call in but i wouldn’t know what to tell my boss. i had called into work last week cause i was sick omg i feel like they would fire me! i’m thinking of pros and cons last time i didn’t call in when i was on my period for the first day i almost fainted i saw my vision blurred and my speech sounded slow and everything looked far away but luckily i clocked out and my sis in law works with me and we got out at the same time so she took me home. I mean yeah i think i’ll go into work and push through the pain like always and if i faint then i faint. and i can’t help but think what if they fire me but then again they never fired this one girl who comes in late every day or they didn’t fire this girl who got written up 10 times and argues with the customers so why would they fire me if i call in with a health issue??,unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

vp-pJXhWwhg_C5073,"STOP SCROLLING 
if you’re here it’s probably because you have really bad cramps to help soothe the pain each month here’s what you’re gonna do

1: make sure that you track your period using an app (i use clue) or write it down somewhere 

2: figure out when your period is predicted to start 

3: take Motrin or ibuprofen the 2 days before your period is supposed to start

i’m telling you this works like a charm and is so easy to do!!",unlabeled,,vp-pJXhWwhg

It's morning and it's started and I have no pad, not even toilet paper or panty liners cause she used those up too and didn't replace them. I used to hide my stack from her but she'd call me selfish and promise to hide hers too even in case of emergency. 
Also I have interview exams for a really competitive law school tomorrow and I've been up all night studying. I was going to shower, put on my pad and sleep before waking up to do more reading. She's ruined my sleep because I felt uncomfortable sleeping in my state. I checked the store and they're freaking closed like always.
